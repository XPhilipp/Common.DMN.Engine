## [Unreleased]##

## [0.1.2] - 2020-07-18 ##
### Added ###
- Support for parsing the DMN 1.3 documents (no additional functionality, just XML namespaces adjustments)

## [0.1.1] - 2019-11-03 ##
### Fixed ###
- Issue with serializer in full .NET framework as described by [@fgollas](https://github.com/fgollas) in [PR#1](https://github.com/adamecr/Common.DMN.Engine/pull/1). Proxy classes are used when there are "hidden" model properties without getters. Added the tests running on .NET framework (the v 0.1.0 code has been tested just for .NET core, where this issue not appeared).
- Some small corrections in read.me
